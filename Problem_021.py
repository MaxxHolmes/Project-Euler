# Solution to Project Euler - Problem 21
# Amicable Numbers by MaxxHolmes

# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n
# (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair
# and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
